                <p class="card-text">Since I recently finished a web development course, I decided to code the webpage
                    myself. I used html, javascript and css to make this webpage.
                    <br><br>
                    The webpage that I created has two parts, the first is a review site (similar to TripAdvisor) where
                    people could leave reviews for places they have been or services they received. Jack Torrance and
                    Dr. Mortimer left reviews. The second part of my webpage is a log of the thoughts of R2-D2. For each
                    character I tried to showcase a relationship as the story went on.

                    <br><br>
                    <u>The Shining:</u>
                    <br><br>
                    The main relationship that I wanted to show was Jack Torrance and The Overlook Hotel. I used the
                    hotel reviews as a timeline of his descent into madness. As the hotel slowly takes him over, the
                    reviews showcase this relationship with The Overlook. The review ratings increase as time goes on
                    signifying the hotel having more off an effect on him. As the reviews go on, you get an inside look
                    into how the hotel is manipulating Jack.
                    <br><br>
                    Another small detail I added was the sign off that Jack uses. Every post is signed “Jack Torrance at
                    The Overlook”, but the final post is signed “Jack Torrance & The Overlook”. Which was done to
                    signify Jack being taken over by the powers of the hotel.

                    <br><br>
                    <u>Hound of Baskerville:</u>
                    <br><br>
                    The main relationship that I wanted to display was Dr. James Mortimers faith in Sherlocks abilities
                    as the case went on. Sherlocks unorthodox nature of deduction tests Mortimers belief in him.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to show Sherlocks unique style of solving cases from a different perspective. All Sherlock
                    stories are told from either Sherlocks or Watsons perspective. I wanted to show how his action might
                    be perceived from someone who recruited him to solve a case. In this perspective Mortimer does not
                    get the luxury of knowing what Sherlock is trying to do, he only sees Sherlocks actions at face
                    value, with no understanding of intentions. My array of reviews on Sherlocks Detective Service
                    fluctuates because Mortimer is unsure of what Sherlock is doing and if he is doing a good job. He
                    ultimately gives him a 5/5 but there are point when it drops to a 3/5.

                    <u>Star Wars: A New Hope:</u>
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to show Luke’s relationship with his confidence through the lens of R2-D2. I chose R2-D2
                    because it provides a ‘fly on the wall’ perspective. Luke starts the movie as a kid from Tatooine
                    but ends the movie as a new jedi warrior. R2-D2s observations capture this transformation. R2-D2
                    also sees how selfless Luke is and how he does not have any ulterior motives to his actions, other
                    than his own morals.

                        season. This Ullman prick who was interviewing me thought he was so much better than me, simply
                        because I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been clean for months now and I have it under
                        control. He even tried to scare me into not taking the job, by telling me about the man who had
                        this job last. That poor sucker went crazy and killed his family. This bastard Ullman thinks
                        that I am so mentally weak, that I will go stir crazy doing such an easy job. This is going to
                        be a breeze; I can write my play and I can get a second chance with my family. The hotel is
                        nice, but Ullman is insufferable, can’t wait to get 6 months away from him and get paid for it.

                    <p class="card-text">I have been here in the Overlook Hotel for a few weeks now. I have doing all my
                        custodial tasks, but it has still left me with lots of time for other things. I have spent my
                        free time writing my play. I have also spent a little bit of time exploring some of the guest
                        amenities that the hotel has to offer. I came across a grand ballroom, with a bar. The bar was
                        emptied out before the Overlook closed, which is probably a good thing because I am recovering.
                        One of the reasons that we are here, is because when I drink, I tend to have some issues with my
                        anger. Still, the ballroom looked magnificent. I can only imagine the parties that can be thrown
                        here. How nice it would be to attend an event like that.
                        <br><br>
                        I did a little bit of exploring in the basement of the hotel and I found an old scrapbook. The
                        Overlook has a fascinating history making the hotel feels like it always has life in it, even
                        when it is just us.

                    <p class="card-text">I have spent the last couple months here at the Overlook. I met the hotel bar
                        tender today, Grady. He is a great listener and I talked to him about all my problems. My damn
                        family has been getting on my nerves, “this inhuman place makes human monsters” (King, 208).
                        <br><br>
                        I calmed down quickly once Grady poured me a drink. I sat there and drank while I talked to him
                        for a while. Once I calmed down, I left with a buzz and went to find my family. This hotel is
                        really growing on me, there’s lots to do. It’s only a shame that my family doesn’t see it too.

                        went to see bartender Grady to try and relax. To my surprise when I went into the ballroom there
                        was a fantastic party happening. I sat and drank with Grady and watched the hoards of people
                        dancing and having the time of their lives. For a moment I was taken away from the stresses of
                        life and I simply enjoyed watching with Grady.

                        through some persuasion I was able to convince him to accept. His deductive abilities shine
                        through his narcissistic demeanor

                    <p class="card-text">Sherlock Holmes is a peculiar man with intriguing tendencies. I have just
                        concluded a meeting with him and the heir to the Baskerville fortune and Sherlock seemed to have
                        a hyper-focused tunnel vision on obscure details that Henry would mention. For example, Henry
                        being a bit tired from his trip across the Atlantic simply “mislaid” (Doyle) one of his boots,
                        but Sherlock took a deep fascination with that detail. He also took a look at a threating letter
                        that was left for Henry and while we thought it was a practical joke, Sherlock seemed to
                        disagree. He quickly and intelligently deciphered the origin of the newspaper used to make the
                        letter. He even went as far as to suggest we do not travel to Devonshire, citing it to be too
                        dangerous. “There is no devil in hell and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from
                        going to the home of my own people” (Doyle) Henry told him. Although clearly intelligent, I am
                        starting to rethink who I hired for this case.

                        are finally starting to shine through his quirky habits. His partner Dr. Watson revealed to
                        me that there was a man following Henry and myself as we left our meeting with Sherlock. He
                        could not tell me more, as the man fled the scene after being spotted by Sherlock. As I
                        previously stated, Henry and I headed out to Devonshire, and I was hoping that Sherlock would
                        accompany us to investigate up close. Unfortunately, he was too busy with his affairs in London
                        to make the trip out, but he has sent Dr. Watson as his eyes on the ground. I was a little
                        apprehensive of Dr. Watson, but they both assured me that he would be reporting back to
                        Sherlock. I must admit that I lost faith in the past few days, but I must trust that his ways
                        have a reason.

                        watches everything like a hawk and scribbles down every detail. Presumably, he will be sending
                        these reports back to London, so Sherlock can have a look, but I am not sure if that will be in
                        time.

                        There has been an uneasy presence felt here in Devonshire, even some reports of a lonely figure
                        in the dark watching over the moors. I sure hope that Sherlock and Watson can solve this case

He has said that he has solved the case and all that is left is to catch the culprit. They put together a plan that seems way too risky. I do not want to risk the life of Sir Henry Baskerville. We have got this far, and I fear that I must simply trust Sherlock and let him use Henry as bait to catch the convict.

                        [Entry 2] From my primary calculations we require 3 able bodies to save the Princess. Luke is

                        far more worried about his own safety then the Princesses. He stated that it is a suicide
                        mission. According to my calculations, it is possible but the room for error is minimal.

                        needed no monetary reward to save Leia, he wanted to do it simply out of empathy.
